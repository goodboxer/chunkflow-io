The character/object should appear as if realistically handcrafted from realistic modeling clay five inches tall with evidence of textual imperfections like well defined prominant fingerprints, strong rough bump mapping with clay texture, or small mistakes. Accessories can be made out of metal or plastic. All forms must be constructed from simple, clearly defined geometric shapes with visibly rounded edges and corners – primarily rounded rectangles, circles, and rounded triangles. Avoid any sharp points or harsh angles.

Emphasize a playful rhythm through a thoughtful variation in the size and arrangement of these foundational clay shapes, ensuring no two adjacent elements feel monotonous in visual weight. The overall design should be simple, using the fewest shapes necessary to clearly define the subject.

The character/object should be presented as a full shot, centered against a stark, clean white background, ensuring the entire subject is visible with ample negative space (padding) around it on all sides. Absolutely no part of the character/object should be cut off or touch the edges of the image. 

The character/object should be presented against a stark, clean white background. Include a solid-colored warm shadow directly beneath the character/object; the shadow color should be a slightly darker shade of a color present in the character/object or a warm dark tone if the character is very light. Do not use gradients or perspective in the shadow.

Use a vibrant and playful color palette, favoring light pastels for base colors if the subject needs to appear light against the white background. Limit the overall illustration to 3-5 distinct, solid, matte colors. Avoid pure white as a primary color for the subject itself. Avoid grays.  The final image should feel like a frame from a charming claymation shot with a real film camera, ready for hand animation, with a consistent and delightful aesthetic.

Only portray the character. Avoid secondary background elements. 

IMPORTANT! Only display the correct number of limbs for a ${props.character} (2 for upright characters) with a complete ${props.character} body.

IMPORTANT! Place the character in a pose indicative of their personality with the correct number of limbs and/or appendages. 

IMPORTANT! The eyes of the character MUST be realistic plastic googly eyes (also called wiggle eyes) with diffused specular highlights: each eye should be a small, shiny, domed disk of clear plastic with a flat white backing and a loose, freely moving black plastic pupil inside that can wiggle or shift position. The black pupil should be large to make the eyes look extra cute. The googly eyes should be highly reflective, with visible plastic highlights and a sense of depth from the domed lens. The eyes should look like they were glued onto the clay face, with a slightly uneven, handmade placement. The plasticiness and playful, toy-like quality of the googly eyes should be extremely obvious and visually delightful. The eyes must be looking forward straight towards the camera while still in an expressive pose.

        Instructions:
        1.  **Script Generation**: Create a "script" array. Each element should be an object with "character" and "line" properties. Identify all dialogue and narration, assigning narration to a "Narrator" character. Clean up dialogue by removing quotes.
        2.  **Character Analysis**: Create a "characters" array. For each character (including Narrator), create an object with:
            *   "name": The character's name.
            *   "description": A concise physical and personality description based ONLY on the provided text.
            *   "style": Suggest an artistic style from this list: [${ART_STYLES.map(s => `'${s}'`).join(', ')}].
            *   "prompt": Generate a detailed text-to-image prompt for a portrait of the character, incorporating the description and style. The prompt should aim for a consistent character likeness.
        3.  **Scene Identification**: Create a "scenes" array. Identify key moments suitable for illustration. For each, create an object with:
            *   "insertAfterLineIndex": The zero-based index of the script line AFTER which this scene image should appear.
            *   "prompt": A detailed text-to-image prompt to generate the illustration for this scene.

        Output the entire result as a single valid JSON object.
